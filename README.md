## Insights
* The even distribution across different age groups and the presence of various gender groups indicate a wide-ranging customer base
* The majority of customers being adults with higher income levels suggests prioritizing SKUs for this customer segment
* Different preferences in various cities highlight the need for region-specific strategies
* Each customer segment (Type 1 to Type 6) shows distinct preferences for certain SKUs, emphasizing the importance of tailored product offerings
* The identification of top SKUs purchased by customers indicates a focused demand for specific products
* Sales vary across different months, locations and customer types, highlighting the need to consider seasonal trends and regional differences in sales strategies.

## Recommendations
